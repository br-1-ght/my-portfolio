          I'm Igwe Bright, a passionate and skilled Front-End & React Developer with a
           strong foundation in modern web technologies and over 2 years of practical experience building responsive, 
           performant, and user-focused websites. I specialize in building clean, scalable web interfaces using React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, 
           and Tailwind, with hands-on knowledge of tools like Git, Netlify, and Figma.

            Iâ€™ve contributed to real-world projects that required not just coding ability, but problem-solving, UX thinking, 
            and team collaboration. Whether it's building reusable components, connecting APIs, or deploying to production, I
            take ownership of the full development cycle with speed and precision.
